How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Fairly confident

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I'd like a bigger picture explanation on how arrays will be used in real world projects. 


What questions do you have about Arrays? In the example below from MDN, is this showing different ways to initiate the pop method and would the code read from top to bottom in this case?



const plants = ['broccoli', 'cauliflower', 'cabbage', 'kale', 'tomato'];

console.log(plants.pop());
// expected output: "tomato"

console.log(plants);
// expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale"]

plants.pop();

console.log(plants);
// expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage"]
